            This platform is an archival space for our early memories.


            <br> <br>
            And yet it is not only an Archive. It is a place where memories are preserved and relived. By archiving early recollections, this work ensures that moments, people, and experiences remain alive.

            <br> <br>
            Early memories inform our identities. Even if they are fragmented or amorphous, these memories act as scaffolds upon which our future perceptions are built. To recall and revisit them is to engage in an act of introspection and mediation.

            If we perceive life not as a sequence of isolated events but rather as a tributary;
            memories are the landmarks along its’ banks. They are not moments frozen in time,
            but the vantage points from which we understand our fluid existence. In the vastness of human cognition,
            memory stands as a testament to our personal and collective histories. our collective psyche and journey.
